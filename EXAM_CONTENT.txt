DhakaCart E-Commerce Reliability Challenge
Background
DhakaCart is a growing e-commerce company in Dhaka specializing in electronics.
The site attracts about 5,000 daily visitors and generates roughly 50 lakh BDT per month in
sales. Last week, DhakaCart ran a major online sale with 5 lakh BDT in marketing spend,
expecting 50,000 visitors. When the sale started, the website crashed for seven hours,
causing an estimated 15 lakh BDT revenue loss. Thousands of customers left angry
messages and switched to competitors like Daraz.
Next Monday, DhakaCart will launch an even larger Eid Sale, spending 8 lakh BDT on
marketing and expecting 100,000 visitors. If the website fails again, management plans to
shut down all online operations, which would result in 15 job losses.
Current System Situation
Hardware & Hosting
- The entire website runs on a single desktop computer (2015) with 8 GB RAM, located
in an office room with broken air conditioning.
- During the last sale, the CPU overheated to 95 °C and shut down automatically.
- There is no backup server — if this computer fails, the entire business stops.
- The system struggles beyond 5,000 concurrent visitors.
Deployment & Maintenance
- Every code update requires stopping the entire site for 1–3 hours.
- The developer manually transfers files using FileZilla from his laptop to the production
computer.
- Deployments often break because local and production environments differ.
- There is no testing or staging environment and no rollback mechanism.
- The site goes offline 2–3 times per week for updates, costing customers and revenue.
Monitoring & Logging
- There is no monitoring system.
- Downtime is discovered only when customers call to complain.
- Once, the site was down for 5 hours overnight without notice.
- The developer manually inspects 500 MB log files to diagnose issues, taking 4+ hours
per incident.
Security & Data Management
- Database passwords are hard-coded inside the source code.
- The database is publicly accessible, with no firewall protection.
- No HTTPS — all user and payment data travel in plain text.
- Weak password encryption and no login rate-limiting.
- Sensitive customer data is stored insecurely, creating potential legal and privacy
liabilities.
Source Code & Backup Practices
- Code exists only on the developer’s laptop, the production computer, and
occasionally in Gmail attachments.
- There is no version control system (e.g., Git).
- Six months ago, the developer’s laptop got infected with a virus, losing two weeks of
work.
- Database backups are done manually every Sunday to an external hard drive, which
recently failed — losing multiple backups.
- If either machine fails, critical code and data could be lost permanently.
Your Mission
Transform DhakaCart’s fragile single-machine setup into a resilient, scalable, and secure
cloud-based e-commerce infrastructure that can:
- Handle 100,000+ concurrent visitors without downtime
- Survive hardware or software failures automatically
- Deploy updates safely and continuously
- Protect customer data through strong security and compliance
- Enable monitoring, logging, and recovery for operational transparency
Key Goals and Requirements
1. Cloud Infrastructure & Scalability
- Migrate the system to the cloud with redundancy and load balancing.
- Run multiple instances of the website behind a load balancer.
- Enable auto-scaling to adjust capacity during traffic surges.
- Protect the database with private subnets and firewalls.
- Define everything using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for easy replication and recovery.
2. Containerization & Orchestration
- Containerize all components — React frontend, Node.js backend, database, and
caching layer.
- Use an orchestration system (e.g., Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) to:
- Maintain multiple healthy replicas
- Perform health checks and self-healing
- Enable rolling updates without downtime
3. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
- Implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline:
- On each code commit: run tests → build containers → deploy automatically
- Use rolling or blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Add automatic rollback if errors occur
- Send notifications for deployment status and failures
- Target: Reduce 3-hour manual updates to 10-minute safe automated deployments.
4. Monitoring & Alerting
- Deploy monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana, CloudWatch, or similar).
- Create real-time dashboards with system health indicators: CPU, memory, latency,
requests, and errors.
- Use color-coded status (green/yellow/red) for quick checks.
- Configure alerts via SMS, email, or chat for anomalies such as high CPU, failed health
checks, or low disk space.
5. Centralized Logging
- Aggregate logs from all servers using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash,
Kibana) or Grafana Loki.
- Support quick searches:
- “Errors in the last hour”
- “Requests from a specific customer”
- Enable visual trend analysis and pattern detection.
6. Security & Compliance
- Manage all passwords and API keys using secrets management (e.g., Vault, AWS
Secrets Manager).
- Enforce HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for encrypted traffic.
- Apply network segmentation to isolate the database.
- Use strong password hashing, rate-limiting, and role-based access control
(RBAC).
- Add container image and dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD.
7. Database Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Automate daily backups stored in secure, redundant locations.
- Support point-in-time recovery and test restoration regularly.
- Consider database replication for automatic failover during outages.
8. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Represent all resources (servers, networks, databases, firewalls, etc.) in code using
Terraform or Pulumi.
- Version control all configurations in Git.
- Allow quick provisioning, replication, or full recovery from code alone.
9. Automation & Operations
- Script server provisioning, software setup, and configuration using Ansible or similar
tools.
- Automate routine maintenance like log rotation, patching, and security updates.
- Simplify new-developer onboarding — setup with just a few commands.
10. Documentation & Runbooks
- Create clear, accessible documentation:
- Architecture diagrams
- Setup and deployment guides
- Troubleshooting and recovery runbooks
- Emergency procedures for outages
- Ensure even junior engineers can understand and operate the system.
Deliverable Scope
Build a prototype or reference implementation that demonstrates:
- Cloud-hosted, load-balanced, auto-scaling infrastructure
- Containerized and orchestrated application
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with monitoring, logging, and backups
- Secure network, secrets, and HTTPS
- Fully reproducible IaC definitions
Flexibility & Innovation Welcome
The constraints in this challenge are a helpful baseline—not handcuffs. You may propose any
alternative architecture, tools, or workflows (e.g., different provisioning, schedulers, data planes,
or scaling controllers) if you can justify them clearly and show that they improve cost efficiency,
reliability, or operability. Your design will be fully accepted—even if it diverges from the
brief—provided you.
In short: you have near-total freedom to design a more effective, cost-optimized solution—just
make it defensible with solid reasoning and evidence.
